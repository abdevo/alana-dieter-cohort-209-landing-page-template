# Here's another assignment to get you guys more practice with making stuff with HTML/CSS.

# Similar to the Login UI Project and the Email Template Project, all you guys have to do is recreate this product landing page, there doesn't have to be any functionality to it. You can pick whatever product you want (as long as it's mostly appropriate) and you can choose to do it all with vanilla CSS, Bootstrap, or with another CSS library like Materialize (just make sure you don't use more than one library at a time).

# You can even choose another kind of UI besides a landing page if you want, be creative!
